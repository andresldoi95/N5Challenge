Thecnical Challenge for N5

In order to install we need to Setup Docker previously.

We also need to have a docker instance with SQL Server, or testing locally, but we need to check appsettings.json on Solution and configure SQL Server Connection Strings.
Using docker it would be as simple as setting up just the correct IP and giving your password.

Elastic search is already configured in App Settings with my testing environment, you can also set them in order to test in your our environment.
